                    <p class="professional">I'm Janet and I'm a first-year undergrad studying mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy working with others to solve challenging problems to understand how different components of a project are interconnected and I like to find ways I can apply my learning. As a young co-op student, I'm eager to explore my interests and gain experiences relevant to my discipline. Having finished my first study term and co-op term, I'm beginning to develop an interest in automation and robotics. Specifically, I'm interested in PLC programming and computer vision. In the future, I also hope to be able to have more opportunities to work on developing industrial AGVs, hybrid/electric cars, and drones.</p>

                    <p class="personal">As a high school student, I enjoyed studying math and physics. In freshman year, I joined the robotics team at my school and had the opportunity to work on an Arduino robot. Unfortunately, I only spent about three months there as my school withdrew from the competition and shut down the robotics team due to underfunding. Despite this, I became interested in programming and took a computer science course the following year where I learned to code in Python. Outside of school, I'm a big fan of Formula 1 racing and I like to tinker with Arduino, go to the arcade with friends, and collect vinyl records.</p>
